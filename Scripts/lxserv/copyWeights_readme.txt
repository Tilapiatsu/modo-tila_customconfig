To install this plugin, simply copy the file "copyWeights.py" in this zip into a "lxserv" folder in your modo scripts folder (and restart modo, if it's open).

If you are unsure where your modo scripts folder is, you can open modo, then select System > Open User Scripts Folder.

If there is no lxserv folder in your MODO Scripts folder, create one and then put the file in there.

Once MODO has been rebooted, you can run the command via ffr.copyweights

It copies the weight values of the background mesh to the foreground mesh for any ITEM-BASED weight maps the meshes share (i.e. a rigged mesh).
